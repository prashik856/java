## Why use gradle?
We have a java class, HelloWorld.java class in our repo.
How to build this to .class file?
How to compile this file?

We can compile it without a build tool using javac.
Manual compilation is a pain. Build tool makes it easy.

We can build a normal jar file to run our java code.

## Gradle Build Tool Solution
```shell
gradlew build
# Easy command to build and test our code
# How does Gradle know?

# build.gradle -> This is our build script
# We provide all dependencies here.
# We can compile it as many times as we want.
# It has a very advanced dependency management system.
```

## Maven
Gradle does not use xml files, rather it uses build scripts to provide plugins.
Performance is better than Maven.

## Installing Gradle
We need Java 8+
```shell
java -version
#java version "21.0.2" 2024-01-16 LTS
#Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 21.0.2+13-LTS-58)
#Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.2+13-LTS-58, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Install gradle as well
```shell
sudo apt install gradle
gradle --version
```

the output looks like this:
```
prashik@prashik-lenovo:~/Documents/Github/java$ gradle --version
java version "21.0.2" 2024-01-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 21.0.2+13-LTS-58)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.2+13-LTS-58, mixed mode, sharing)

------------------------------------------------------------
Gradle 4.4.1
------------------------------------------------------------

Build time:   2012-12-21 00:00:00 UTC
Revision:     none

Groovy:       2.4.21
Ant:          Apache Ant(TM) version 1.10.14 compiled on September 25 2023
JVM:          21.0.2 (Oracle Corporation 21.0.2+13-LTS-58)
OS:           Linux 6.11.0-19-generic amd64
```

Better way to install it would be from here:
```shell
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html#linux_installation
```

## Create a new project with gradle
```shell
gradle init
```
It will ask some questions, we can answer them easily, and this will create a new gradle basic project for us.

## Gradle Project Files
- settings.gradle - Add high level configuration for the project
- build.gradle - build script configuration file
- gradlew - for linux and mac envs. gradlew.bat is for windows. This is a gradle wrapper. this wrapper will always download the gradle version which is used by the project.
- .gitignore - Used for git.

## Using Gradle Wrapper
```shell
./gradlew tasks
```

The output:
```
Build Setup tasks
-----------------
init - Initializes a new Gradle build.
updateDaemonJvm - Generates or updates the Gradle Daemon JVM criteria.
wrapper - Generates Gradle wrapper files.

Help tasks
----------
artifactTransforms - Displays the Artifact Transforms that can be executed in root project 'learning'.
buildEnvironment - Displays all buildscript dependencies declared in root project 'learning'.
dependencies - Displays all dependencies declared in root project 'learning'.
dependencyInsight - Displays the insight into a specific dependency in root project 'learning'.
help - Displays a help message.
javaToolchains - Displays the detected java toolchains.
outgoingVariants - Displays the outgoing variants of root project 'learning'.
projects - Displays the sub-projects of root project 'learning'.
properties - Displays the properties of root project 'learning'.
resolvableConfigurations - Displays the configurations that can be resolved in root project 'learning'.
tasks - Displays the tasks runnable from root project 'learning'.
```

## Project, build script, tasks and plugin
- Project - Container for everything. It will have build script and everything.
- Build Script - the build.gradle file in our project
- tasks - we define the tasks inside our build script task A, task B, task C. Tasks can be to compile, test or do something else with our code.
- plugin - if we add a plugin to our project, it automatically adds tasks to our project.


Run gradle tasks like this:
```shell
./gradlew <task-name>

# Example
./gradlew tasks

# tasks itself it a task which displays all the tasks.
```

Plugin example:
we have a java plugin in our code which will automatically add some new tasks in our project.
We don't have to reinvent everything. We can include a plugin in our code to run that task for us.

## Groovy
Gradle Groovy DSL (Domain Specific Language)

Groovy is a scripting language. We can write our code outside of a class to run it.
```groovy
def myVar = 'Executing as a script'
println myVar
```
Groovy is a dynamically typed language, so type is not required when defining a variable.
Semicolon is not required as well as it is a scripting language.

```groovy
def multiply(first, second) {
    println first * second
}
multiply 2, 3
```
Brackets are not required to pass in parameters.

Define closures using Closing Brackets.
```groovy
def myClosure = {
    println 'Executing closure'
}
myClosure()
```

## Building a Java Application
By default, gradle expects the code to be in 
`src/main/java` file.

After adding java plugin, we can run tasks task again.
```shell
./gradlew tasks
```

New output from this:
```
Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.
buildDependents - Assembles and tests this project and all projects that depend on it.
buildNeeded - Assembles and tests this project and all projects it depends on.
classes - Assembles main classes.
clean - Deletes the build directory.
jar - Assembles a jar archive containing the classes of the 'main' feature.
testClasses - Assembles test classes.

Build Setup tasks
-----------------
init - Initializes a new Gradle build.
updateDaemonJvm - Generates or updates the Gradle Daemon JVM criteria.
wrapper - Generates Gradle wrapper files.

Documentation tasks
-------------------
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the 'main' feature.

Help tasks
----------
artifactTransforms - Displays the Artifact Transforms that can be executed in root project 'learning'.
buildEnvironment - Displays all buildscript dependencies declared in root project 'learning'.
dependencies - Displays all dependencies declared in root project 'learning'.
dependencyInsight - Displays the insight into a specific dependency in root project 'learning'.

tasks - Displays the tasks runnable from root project 'learning'.

Verification tasks
------------------
check - Runs all checks.
test - Runs the test suite.
```

Let's run the build task.
```shell
./gradlew build
```

We will have a new directly called build.
`build/classes/java/main` will have all the .class files compiled.

In `build/libs` directly, gradle has also created a jar file.
This file will have our class files.

If we try running this file,
```shell
java -jar build/libs/learning.jar
```

Output:
```
prashik@prashik-lenovo:~/Documents/Github/java/gradle/learning$ java -jar build/libs/learning.jar
no main manifest attribute, in build/libs/learning.jar
```
This means gradle does not know which java class to run inside the jar.

## Configuring Tasks
The jar task is responsible for creating this new jar file.
We can configure our jar task in build.gradle file.
Now we can regenerate our jar file, and run our jar again.

```shell
./gradlew build
java -jar build/libs/learning.jar
```
This time, we are able to run our jar file.

## Testing
In Gradle, tests go into 
`src/test/java`

## Specifying dependencies
Specify dependencies in dependency Closure.
Now, after these dependencies are added, we need to tell gradle, from which repository it needs to pull the dependencies from.

We can do it in repositories method.

In Groovy, we can leave out brakets when calling a method only when it has one or more parameters to pass.
If no parameters to pass, we need to pass brackets.

Run build again
```shell
./gradlew build
```
This will also run tests for us.

We can check the test report in `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` file.
Open this file, it will show us the results in html page.

## Summary
- apply java plugin
- compile Java code with build task
- configured jar task
- added dependency
- ran test
