# Java Differences

## Default imports
These are the default imports:
```
    java.io.*

    java.lang.*

    java.math.BigDecimal

    java.math.BigInteger

    java.net.*

    java.util.*

    groovy.lang.*

    groovy.util.*
```

## Multi-Methods
In Groovy, the methods which will be invoked are chosen at runtime. This is called runtime dispatch or multi-methods. It means that the method will be chosen based on the types of the arguments at runtime. In Java, this is the opposite: methods are chosen at compile time, based on the declared types.
See code differenceFromJava.groovy for more details.

## Array Initializers
```java
int[] array = {1, 2, 3};             // Java array initializer shorthand syntax
int[] array2 = new int[] {4, 5, 6};  // Java array initializer long syntax
```

In Groovy, the { …​ } block is reserved for closures. That means that you cannot create array literals using Java’s array initializer shorthand syntax.
