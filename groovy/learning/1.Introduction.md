# Introduction - Differences from Java

## Default imports

## Multile methods
Methods which will be invoked are chosen at runtime. This is called runtime dispatch or multi-methods. Method will be chosen based on the types of arguments at runtime.
In Java, methods are chosen at compile time.
```java
int method(String arg) {
    return 1;
}

int method(Object arg) {
    return 2;
}

Object o = "Object";
int result = method(o)

// In java, we would have
assertEquals(2, result);

// In Groovy
assertEquals(1, result);
```
That is because Java will use the static information type, which is that o is declared as an Object, whereas Groovy will choose at runtime, when the method is actually called.
Since it is called with a String, then the String version is called.


## Array initializers
In Java, array initializers take either of these two forms:
```java
int[] array = {1, 2, 3};             // Java array initializer shorthand syntax
int[] array2 = new int[] {4, 5, 6};  // Java array initializer long syntax
```
In Groovy, the { …​ } block is reserved for closures. That means that you cannot create array literals using Java’s array initializer shorthand syntax. You instead borrow Groovy’s literal list notation like this:
```groovy
int[] array = [1, 2, 3]
```

For Groovy 3+, you can optionally use the Java’s array initializer long syntax:
```groovy
def array2 = new int[] {1, 2, 3} // Groovy 3.0+ supports the Java-style array initialization long syntax
```

## Package scope visibility
In Groovy, omitting a modifier on a field doesn’t result in a package-private field like in Java:
```groovy
class Person {
    String name
}
// By default, name won't be private
```

It is possible to create a package-private field by annotating it with @PackageScope
```groovy
class Person {
    @PackageScope String name
}
// this creates a private field
```
